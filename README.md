# Soundcloud Waveforms

You are now on the `start` branch which is the initial state of the app.

This works as any other Expo application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eveningkid/react-native-soundcloud-waveforms.git
cd react-native-soundcloud-waveforms
git checkout start
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can follow along [the YouTube video](https://youtu.be/lhOXm2UFB18) or checkout to `main` to see the final code.
